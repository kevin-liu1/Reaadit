## Introduction
Reaadit is an Reddit client that is fast, minimalistic and written completely in Swift 5. I enhanced my skills with REST APIs and JSON parsing by getting familiar with Reddit's API. I also implemented Reddit's OAuth 2 Security with an ASWebAuthenticationSession to log in the User and securely gain access to their account information. After security access, the app is able to access all sorts of functionality; API integration, security, refresh tokens, dynamic information processing, up/down voting, user subreddit sub information, youtube integration, and URL image processing.
